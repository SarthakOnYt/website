                    Welcome to InfernoMind Studios where we develop projects for all to enjoy, starting off with a Discord Multi-purpose Game Bot. We have a variety of content to share with you and
                    can't wait to enjoy it with all of you. Feedback is very important to us as we make sure to follow what the community wants. All feedback is read thoroughly and enforced as soon as
                    possible. Any feedback that is confusing or has some type of misunderstanding will be met with a discussion with that individual to make sure we fully understand what is being
                    asked of us. While we build projects for our enjoyment, we also make sure the community is heard and build it for you.
